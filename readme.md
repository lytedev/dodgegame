# Dodge

A simple game I made to play with the `<canvas>` API as a platform for games.

Dodge the falling blocks, use your slomo ability for finer movements, and grab
the dots to get the highest possible score before the blocks fall in numbers too
great to be avoided!

## ToDo

* Abstract sweg into its own repo.

Note: This was written before the awesome ECMAScript 6 modules were commonplace.
